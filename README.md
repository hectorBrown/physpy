# physpy
Some random physics sims.

These files rely on a weird, over the top library I wrote for the Year 1 Physics course at ICL, install this dependency with either:

- Method 1: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hectorBrown/physpy`
- Method 2:
	1. Clone the module however you'd like.
	2. `cd physpy`
	3. `git submodule init`
	4. `git submodule update`
